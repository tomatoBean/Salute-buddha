Useful learning tools in buddhism
==================================


If you believe in Buddha, we have a million billion different Buddhas to help people through their lives. 
If you don't believe, we don't have it. 
Just like all religions and philosophies, there are living Buddhas, living Gods, living Jesus Christs all around us, 
guiding people and helping them continue on and express their paths. 

All of the great leaders helping people, you can see it, you can hear it, those are living Buddhas, living Boddhisattvas. 

Understand why we pray - in all the religions, people pray for the same thing - for peace, for love, for respect, to help people. 

Only do good things, don't do bad. 

Do whatever you can to help others. 

By helping others, you help yourself. Help yourself, and you help the world.
